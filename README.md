# HackUmass18
Reddit bot for HackUmass Project.  This is a bot modelled after the Skeleseer in the Left Behind DLC for The Last of Us.  In this version, upon noticing the set phrase in a comment, it will respond with one of the 9 phrases mentioned in the game's dialogue.  Version 1.0 of this bot was written entirely during the weekend October 13-14.
